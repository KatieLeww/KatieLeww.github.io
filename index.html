    <p>This is an inline container, <span style="color: red">"span."</span> </p>

    <p>This is <em>emphasized text</em> and this is <i>italicized text</i>, though I can't tell the difference.</p>

    <p>This is <b>bold text</b> and this is <strong>important/strong text</strong>, though again I can't tell the difference.</p>

    <p><mark>I'm highlighted!</mark></p>

    <p><s>I'm marked through.</s></p>

    <p>HELLO<sub>hello!</sub>HELLO</p>

    <p>This is average text. This is <sup>super!</sup> text.</p>

    <P>This is regular text. <small>This is petite and dainty text.</small></P>

    <p>This is an address inline element: <address>9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093</address></p>

    <p>This is for textual citations, but it also just looks italicized. <cite>This is my citation.</cite></p>

    <p>Though it seems simple to do myself, this is the inline element for <q>quotations.</q></p>

    <p>Line 1. <br> Line dos.</p>

        <div style="width:200px">
            This is a possible line break where you set the width of the text and the rest should go to the next line.
        </div>
    </p>

    <p>This is to format the date. <time datetime="2023-06-11">The day today is 06-11-2023</time></p>
